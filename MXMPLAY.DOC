    Introduction
==============================================================================

  This is a MOD and XM player package for the Gravis UltraSound in flat mode.
  It was optimized for size not for speed. The size is about 5.3k or 3.6k
  if you pack it with PMWLITE. It was designed for the compo version of
  64k intros, especially for the Party 5 held in the end of December'95
  in Fredericia/Denmark. It supports nearly all XM effects and features.
  It supports the GUS and no device. It supports at least the DOS4GW
  dos-extender by Rational Systems and PMODE/W 1.20 by Charles Sheffold
  and Thomas Pytel. It supplies timer and music syncronisation functions
  for your production. You can also play S3Ms, but the player will only
  play what FastTracker 2 by Triton makes of it.
  If you find any incompatibilities with FT2 please tell me.

    The conversion program:
==============================================================================

  XM2MXM [options] source [dest]

  This program converts an XM to the internal format called MXM.
  You might ask why another format, but this format shall not be used
  for music interchange, it is just very easy to read and made the code
  about 1k smaller.
  If you want to play MODs or S3Ms you have to convert them to XM first.

  options:
    -p0:   XM-panning (instruments) (default)
    -p1:  MOD-panning (LRRLLRRL)
    -p2:  MOD-panning (less extreme)
    -p3:  S3M-panning (LRLRLRLR)
    -p4:  S3M-panning (less extreme)
    -p5:    0-panning (MMMMMMMM)

  if you want to play a MOD use -p1, -p2 to use correct panning.
  A converted S3M would need -p3/4 if it uses standard panning, otherwise
  you'd have to change the panning values in the header of the mxm.
  (use -p1 and look for 00FFFF0000FFFF00...)




    The MXM Format:
==============================================================================

  The MXM Format was designed to be easy to read, small, for use on a GUS
  only, and to support all of FastTracker 2's featues.
  It uses S3M like pattern packing, so you can increase the number of
  channels without a change in size (of course they would have to stay
  clear). The pattern packing of XM would increase the size. The MXM format
  uses NO SAMPLE PACKING, though it can use "delta values". If you want to
  pack the samples, you can do so, as long as the song is passed to the
  xmpInit routine unmodified. 3 dwords in the header tell you where to
  find the samples and how many there are:
    offset 1Ch: offset of the samples
    offset 20h: number of 8 bit samples
    offset 24h: number of 16 bit samples

  You will find more detailed information on the format in the source code.




    Notes on the implementation of the XM format:
==============================================================================

  E3x  (glissando control)       not implemented
  E5x  (finetune)                not implemented
  EFx  (funk repeat???)          set sync value
  Lxx  (set envelope position)   not implemented
  Txx  (tremor)                  not implemented
  Sxx  -                         set sync value

  all other commands and features should be supported correctly.



    MXMPLAY.ASM and its functions:
==============================================================================

  The object file was compiled with TASM 3.1 using .386 and .model flat,c
  The segments and groups are the ones needed for Watcom C++ 10.0.

  -segments:
    -the code segment is _TEXT (dword public use32 class 'CODE')
    -the data segment is _DATA (dword public use32 class 'DATA')
    -the uninitialized data segment is _BSS (dword public use32 class 'BSS')
    -DGROUP consists of _DATA and _BSS
  -all function names end with an underscore and are case sensitive
  -parameters are passed in registers
  -there must be a global variable "__psp" that holds the selector of the
   program segment prefix
  -on entry to all functions the following must be true:
    -CS must point to _TEXT
    -DS must point to _DATA
    -ES must point to _DATA
    -SS must point to _DATA
    -the direction flag must be clear

  C(++) coders must include mxmplay.h for correct access.
  Assembler coders must make their own include files depending on their code,
  assembly equivalents for the C(++) stuff are in brackets.

  The object consists of the following functions:

    xmpInit
    xmpPlay
    xmpStop
    xmpSetVolume
    xmpGetSync
    xmpGetPos
    xmpGetTimer



xmpInit: (xmpInit_)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  int xmpInit(void *mxmmem, unsigned long pspsel, unsigned long maxtimerrate);

  Inits the soundsystem and prepares the module for playing.

  mxmmem: (esi)
    Pointer to the module. You must load the complete module from disk
    and pass the address to this function.

  pspseg: (eax)
    Selector of the Program Segement Prefix. C(++) coders should use _psp.
    You can also specify the port directly by setting the MSb.
    (eg: 0x80000220)

  maxtimerrate: (ecx)
    The maximum number of clock ticks (1193046 ticks/sec) between two
    irq 0 calls. Never set this to more than 65536. Set this to 65536 if
    you want to have a periodically called routine. Install your interrupt
    handler after starting to play and deinstall before stopping to play.
    The interval between two subsequent calls to the interrupt is no longer
    than this value, but will vary while runtime.

  returnvalue: (eax)
    0: failed
    1: ok

  modifies: eax ebx ecx edx esi edi



xmpPlay: (xmpPlay_)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  void xmpPlay(unsigned int startord);

  Enables the timer services and starts to play the module.

  startord: (eax)
    start playing at this order

  modifies: eax ebx ecx edx esi edi



xmpStop: (xmpStop_)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  void xmpStop();

  Stop the sound output and disables the timer services.

  modifies: eax ebx ecx edx esi edi



xmpSetVolume: (xmpSetVolume_)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  void xmpSetVolume(unsigned char vol);

  Set the relative volume.

  vol: (al)
    range 0 to 64.

  modifies: nothing



xmpGetSync: (xmpGetSync_)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  unsigned char xmpGetSync();

  Returns the currently set syncvalue. You set the syncvalue with the command
    EFx or Sxx. I do not really know how you usually do syncronisation, but
    this might help. :)

  returnvalue: (al)
    the syncvalue

  modifies: al



xmpGetPos: (xmpGetPos_)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  unsigned short xmpGetPos();

  Returns the current position in the song.

  returnvalue: (ax)
    highbyte: current order
     lowbyte: current row

  modifies: ax



xmpGetTimer: (xmpGetTimer_)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  long xmpGetTimer();

  Returns the timer value. This values starts at the first tick of the
  module and counts up all the time at a rate of 1193046Hz.

  returns: (eax)
    the number of timer ticks since the first tick of the module.

  modifies: eax
